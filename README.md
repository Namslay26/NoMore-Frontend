# NOMOre 
Ever find yourself looking through social media only to find out your friends are hanging out or partying somewhere? Do you find yourself walking through somewhere and find people in big groups having fun? Feeling FOMO yet? Well say NOMOre to that!

## Project Overview
NOMOre is a website that helps deal with FOMO by creating awareness about it and helping the user cope and overcome the fear of missing out. 

## The Problem
### What is FOMO
FOMO (“fear of missing out”) is a social phenomenon which is closely linked to usage of social media. It is a psychological strain that is caused due to multiple reasons, many of which have social media as their primary source.
### Why is it an issue
Social media puts all our lives on a pedestal.  This makes the audience question their lives, whether it is as fun and lively as how social media portrays it to be. Hence, they end up comparing their own lives to others, inducing emotions like jealousy, self-hatred, low esteem, and loneliness. People then tend to feel socially excluded or isolated from how their friend groups are seen online and disconnect themselves from the real connections made. 

## Our Solution
Our website offers the following features, 

#### No Social media time
Here, the user can select the social media sites that need to be blocked. They can also choose how long the websites are blocked. 
#### Together time reminder 
The user is encouraged to call their friends or family members. Here, to induce conversation, a set of questions are shown to them to ask their caller. If they have not called their loved ones yet, the site pushes notifications on regular intervals. 
#### Mindfulness
#### Gratitude time
